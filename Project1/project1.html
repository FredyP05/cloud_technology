            <h2>What is Guatemala?</h2>
            <p>Guatemala, a Central American country south of Mexico, is home to volcanoes, rainforests and ancient
                Mayan sites. The capital, Guatemala City, features the stately National Palace of Culture and the
                National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. Antigua, west of the capital, contains preserved Spanish
                colonial buildings. Lake Atitlán, formed in a massive volcanic crater, is surrounded by coffee fields
                and villages.

                Known as the Land of the Eternal Spring, Guatemala belongs to the seven countries that conform Central
                America. The tropical weather and interwoven traditions make this region of the world perfect for
                culture-lovers.

            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>Guatemalan culture is rich and distinct, characterized by a fusion of Spanish and Indigenous influences.
                Guatemalans value honesty, family, honor, work, and education. Most Guatemalans are gracious and eager
                to find humor in most situations. In Guatemalan culture, visiting friends and relatives is important.
                <br>
                <br>
                The most famous celebration in all of Guatemala is Semana Santa—the weeklong observance of Christian
                Holy Week. The festivities in Antigua are arguably the most impressive in Latin America.

            <h2>History of Guatemala</h2>
            <p>Guatemala attained independence from Spain and Mexico in 1821. From 1823 to 1841, it was part of the
                Federal Republic of Central America. For the latter half of the 19th century, Guatemala suffered
                instability and civil strife.

            <h3>Facts about Guatemala</h3>
            <li>The original name of Guatemala was Quauhtlemallan, which means ‘place of many trees’ in the Mexican
                language Nahuatl. In fact, most of the departments’ names were given by the Mexican warriors that
                accompanied the Spanish troops during the colonization time in Guatemala.</li>
            <li>Guatemala hosts the largest city in Central America. Overlooked by most visitors, Guatemala City is an
                interesting mix of old and new. Over the centuries the Capital of Guatemala had grown to a metropolis;
                today it is the home of almost 3 million people. Its Historical Center is 244 years old whereas the
                modern areas are constantly adapting to the new trends.</li>
            <li>Almost half of the population in Guatemala is indigenous descendant from the Maya civilization. The
                modern society still practices pre-hispanic traditions that allow them to preserve their heritage.
                Today, around 20 different Mayan languages are still spoken and different Mayan communes are spread
                throughout the country.</li>
            <li>
                Some of the most important Mayan cities flourished in Guatemala around 5,000 years ago. The Maya
                achieved stunning advances in mathematics and astronomy, developed an extraordinary writing system and
                built monumental structures dedicated to their deities. Trace of these impressive achievements can be
                found in every region of Guatemala. Among the most important and largest Mayan cities are Tikal and El
                Mirador.</li>

            <h2>Currency</h2>
            <p>The quetzal is the currency of Guatemala, named after the national bird of Guatemala, the resplendent
                quetzal. In ancient Mayan culture, the quetzal bird's tail feathers were used as currency. It is divided
                into 100 centavos, or len in Guatemalan slang.</p>
